## React specific supported functionalities

### Typescript

The App is written in Typescript. Configuration can be found at [./tsconfig.json](./tsconfig.json). Target version is for es5 and strict mode is enabled.

### Redux

App is fully integrated with [redux](https://redux.js.org). All stores, reducers and actions are in the [./src/redux](./src/redux). Store is configured to use [thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) that allows dispatching asynchronous actions. 

### Axios

App uses HTTP client [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for communication with backend. Configuration can be found at [./src/util/APIUtils.ts](./src/util/APIUtils.ts)

### Localization
  Localization was implemented using  [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/). 
  All localization related stuff are stored under [./src/i18n](./src/i18n). [I18nConfig.ts](./src/i18n/I18nConfig.ts) contains basic configuration. All translations for specific language are then stored in translation.json file that is in the folder named based on given locale. 
  Translations are then loaded using **useTranslation()** hook. 
  For example:
  ```
 const {t, i18n} = useTranslation();
  ....
 <div>t('ns1:aboutAppLabel')}</div>
```
The locale is also used for communication with backed which also supports localization so messages coming from backed will also be translated into correct language.

### Theme support
  App supports light and dark theme. Theme colors are set in [./src/index.scss](./src/index.scss). Toggler is part of the [AppHeader](./src/components/navigation/AppHeader.tsx) component and selected theme is set using redux. Main component [App](./src/components/App.tsx) then uses `useEffect` hook to change body class. Theme choice is also saved into a Cookie.
